              Combating the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic requires the rapid identification of people who have come into recent contact with confirmed cases
              of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This allows for timely interventions such as evacuation and disinfection of spaces and for assistance in locating people
              who have been close to a carrier or have been exposed to the virus, so that they too can be appropriately tested or treated.
